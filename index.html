    <h3>4. What are CSS Combinators?</h3>
    <p>Combinators combine the selectors to provide them a useful relationship and the
        position of content in the document. This comes in handy when you want to style
        certain elements all at once rather than styling elements individually. CSS
        combinator selectors are as follows.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Descendant Selector (space)</li>
        <li>Child Selector (>)</li>
        <li>Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)</li>
        <li>General Sibling Selector (~)</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Descendant Selector (space):</b>The descendant selector matches all elements that are
            descendants of a specified element.
    </p>
    <div class="d">
        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
        <p>I am child paragraph</p>
        <p>I am child paragraph</p>
        </div>
    <p><b>Child Selector (>):</b> The child selector will only affect elements under a direct
            parent. A good way to remember this is that a child will only listen to its direct
            parents.
    </p>
    <div class="c">
        <h2>This heading is a direct child of the div tag.</h2>
        <p>So is this paragraph tag.</p>
        <button>
            <p>This paragraph tag is NOT a direct child of the first div</p>
        </button>
        <p>This paragraph tag is also a child of the div tag</p>
    </div>
    <p><b>Adjacent Sibling Selector :</b> To use the adjacent sibling selector in your CSS
                    stylesheet, you simply need the plus (+) sign. The adjacent sibling selector is used
                    to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
    </p>
    <div class="a">
        <h2>This is a H2 tag.</h2>
        <p>This p tag immediately follows the heading.</p>
        <button>
            <p>This p tag is NOT immediately following a H2 tag.</p>
        </button>
        <h2>Howdy! This is another H2 tag.</h2>
        <p>This p tag is after another H2 tag and gets formatted.</p>
    </div>
    <p><b>General Sibling Selectors :</b> The general sibling selector follows through on all
                            elements under the targeted HTML element selected. This means that if another
                            element tag interrupts the direct adjacent flow, the style rules can still follow
                            through.
    </p>
    <div>
        <h2>I am heading tag!</h2>
        <p>I am paragraph tag 1.</p>
        <button>
            <p>I am a paragraph tag inside a button!</p>
       </button>
        <p>I am paragraph tag 2.</p>
        <p>I am paragraph tag 3.</p>
        <h3>I am another heading tag!</h3>
        <p>I am paragraph tag 4.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>5. What are pseudo Scelectors?</h3>
    <p>CSS pseudo-classes are used to add styles to selectors, but only when those
        selectors meet certain conditions. A pseudo class is expressed by adding a colon (:)
        after a selector in CSS, followed by a pseudo-class such as "hover", "focus", or
        "active", like this:</p>
        <b>Syntax:</b>
    <pre>
    selector:pseudo-class {
        property : value;
    }
    </pre>
    <p><b>Some Examples of Pseudo-Class:</b></p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>:active</th>
            <td>It is used to add style to an active element.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>:hover</th>
            <td>It adds special effects to an element when the user moves the
                mouse pointer over the element</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>:link</th>
            <td>It adds style to the unvisited link.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>:visited</th>
            <td>It adds style to a visited link.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>:lang</th>
            <td>It is used to define a language to use in a specified element.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>:focus</th>
            <td>It selects the element which is focused by the user currently.</td>
        </tr>   
    </table>
